      <h5>Electric Vehicles</h5>
      <p>EVs (also known as plug-in electric vehicles) derive all or part of
        their power from electricity supplied by the electric grid. They include AEVs and PHEVs.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="car-types">
      <h5>All-electric vehicles</h5>
      <p>AEVs (all-electric vehicles) are powered by one or more electric motors.
        They receive electricity by plugging into the grid and store it in batteries.
        They consume no petroleum-based fuel and produce no tailpipe emissions.
        AEVs include Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs).</p>

    <article class="car-types">
      <h5>Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles</h5>
      <p>PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) use batteries to power an electric motor,
        plug into the electric grid to charge, and use a petroleum-based or alternative fuel
         to power the internal combustion engine. Some types of PHEVs are also called extended-range
         electric vehicles (EREVs).</p>
